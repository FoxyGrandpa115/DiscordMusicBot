# Discord Music bot

A discord bot that can play music from youtube queries, under development.

##current problems: 
need to refactor commands for discord.js version 14 update and later versions
playback seems to end after 60 seconds (should be fixed soon), need playlist functionality


## Getting Started

You could pretty much plug and play, but you will need to login to discord and make your own bot which will generate a token in the <YOUR TOKEN HERE>
part of index.js


once you have your token, open the directory of DiscordMusicBot in terminal, then type 'node .' and Enter. If the bot is online, it should be ready to be used.
### Prerequisites

Requires: 
discord.js ^13.8.1
"play-dl": ^1.9.5
### Installing

### Troubleshooting
use `npm i @discordjs/voice@latest` to update discordjs if bot stops after 60 seconds of playback.
